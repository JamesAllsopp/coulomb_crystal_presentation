## Why {.smaller}

- Fundamental Chemistry: studying exactly how two species react
- Need a few, very cold atoms confined in a small space
  - At higher temperature, too many complications
    - Kinetic energy of reactants
    - Many combinations of internal energy states
    - Quantum effects displayed on much shorter scales
  - Confinement puts them close enough to interact
- Testable prediction: Theory since 1905 predicts reaction rate should have no temperature dependence

# How
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
Two requirements to this:

- Confinement
- Cooling

Then ionised species self-organise into a "Coulomb Crystal" ^[Shhh, it's not really a crystal, it's a strongly-coupled plasma]

## Confinement {auto-animate=true}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Fire neutral atoms into a electric field
- Shine a laser at the atoms to ionise them
- Problem is static fields don't work

## Laser Cooling {auto-animate=true, .smaller}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Laser tuned to atom's absorption band hits atom
- Atom excited and recoils away from laser
- Light then re-emitted in a random direction

## Laser Cooling {auto-animate=true, .smaller}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Tune the laser to a longer wavelength - lower energy
- Only the atoms moving fastest towards the laser can absorb.
- Energy lost from the system from the hottest atoms
- System as whole then cools down

### But this only works for one species

- Sympathetic cooling
  - Use Ca<sup>+</sup> to cool species that you aren't able to laser cool by collisions.


## Reactions in progress {.smaller}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

 Ca<sup>+</sup> (trapped) + CH<sub>3</sub>F &#8594;  CaF<sup>+</sup> +  CH<sub>3</sub>

- CH<sub>3</sub> is uncharged and leaves the trap.
- CaF<sup>+</sup> doesn't fluoresce at this wavelength
- Fewer Ca<sup>+</sup> ions as time progresses, allows measurement of reaction rate
- Lighter Ca<sup>+</sup> ions sink to the centre of the crystal changing its observed shape

## Great - Where do we come in
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

Experimenters compare the microscope image to simulated images to work out the number of each species.

## Plan of work {.smaller}

Predict the numbers of Ca<sup>+</sup> ions initially, then infer the numbers of lighter or heavier species.

Start with pure Ca<sup>+</sup> crystals.

- Improve the simulation code
  - Currently takes 3 mins for ~50 ions, but scales as (N<sub>ions</sub>)<sup>2
  - Image augmentation (still need to simulate ~700000 images)
- Run a Convolutional Neural Network on the simulated data set.
- Try and use a GAN transform simulated images to be more like experimental images - small numbers of experimental images
- Use PyTorch to try and learn the number of ions from the transformed images.

## Currently  {.smaller}

Using BlueBear to simulate crystals

- Using a Slurm array to run 4000 simulations
- Running 500 jobs in parallel

Hashing the filenames to produce a 6:1 training validation set

- Can start training tapping off simulations as they complete without leakage

Can't just load dataset into memory

- Using WebDataSet in PyTorch to package these images into shards of 500 images with labels: tar files
- Allows shuffling, pre-loading and caching of images

## Applications

- Atomic clocks based on these technologies are at the root of timekeeping
  - Caesium fountains accurate to 1s in 300 million years.
- Foundation of the NTP system - stratum 1
  - Defense against replay attacks - kerberos
  - Navigation - GPS speed of light 1ft per nanosecond.
