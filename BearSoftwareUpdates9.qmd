## Why
::: {.incremental}
- Want to study chemical reactions in the quantum regime
  - Theory since 1905 predicts no temperature dependence
  - Need few, very cold atoms confined in a small space.
  - Species self-organise into a "Coulomb Crystal" ^[Shhh, it's not really a crystal, it's a strongly-coupled plasma]

## Great - Where do we come in
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

Experimenters compare the microscope image to simulated images to work out the number of each species.

# How

Two parts to this, confinement and cooling


## Confinement {auto-animate=true}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Fire neutral atoms into a electric field
- Shine a laser at the atoms to ionise them

- Problem is you can't do this with static fields

## Laser Cooling 
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Use the Doppler Effect to blue-shift a laser's wavelength.
  - Moves it from just below the absorbtion energy, to the absorbtion energy
- But only for the hottest species moving towards the laser.
- Fluorescence emitted in all directions.

## But this only works for one species

- Sympathetic cooling
  - Use Ca<sup>+</sup> to cool species that you aren't able to laser cool by colllisions.

## Plan of work {.smaller}

Eventually infer the numbers of Ca, numbers of heavier species, and numbers of lighter species.

Start with pure Ca<sup>+</sup> crystals.

- Improve the simulation code
  - Currently takes 3 mins for ~50 ions, but scales as (N<sub>ions</sub>)<sup>2
  - Image augmentation (still need to simulate ~40000 images)
  - CUDA
  
- Try and use a GAN to make simulated images more realistic - difficult
- Use PyTorch to try and learn the number of ions from the experimental images.

## Non-deep learning

## Applications

- Atomic clocks based on these technologies are at the root of timekeeping
  - Caesium fountains accurate to 1s in 300 million years.
- Foundation of the NTP system - stratum 1
  - Defense against replay attacks - kerberos
  - Navigation - GPS speed of light 1ft per nanosecond.
